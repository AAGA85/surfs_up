# INVESTING IN WAVES AND ICE CREAM

My last vacation in Hawaii gives me an idea, I visualized a business opportunity that I think is foolproof: a Surf n'Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourist. Even I have some money to invest, I would need an investor backing to get this off the ground. So, after putting together a strong business plan, I decided to reach out to an investor W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing. The first meeting with him was very well but he had one concern, the weather. He invested in a surg shop early in his career, but he never asked for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence. So, in order to convince him that this is a great idea and close the deal, I need to run some weather analysis to support the business plan.

In this module, I have run some general analysis about precipitation and temperature in a year as well as I have created some plots to show the data easily to understand and get conclusions.

Below we can see the data that has convinced  W. Avy to invest in this business: the statitstics of the precipitation of 1 year study and the last 12 months of temperature observation data for one station.

We are almost ready to close this business with W. Avy needs more data prior to take a final decision. In this challenge, I will provide some statistics of the temperature for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.



# Results

*Temperature statistics*

Below is the statistics of the temperatures for the months of June and December.

From these results we can conclude the following:

a) The mean or the arithmetic average, ideally this means indicates the region where most values in a distribution fall. That means in June the average temperature is 75 degrees and in December the average is 71. Just 4 grades difference, this is not a big deal considering 6 months difference. 

b) Nevertheless, the mean does not always find the center of the data and it could be misleading, consequently, we need to evaluate another characteristic, the standard deviation. The standard deviation will help us to understand the variability in a dataset. It represents the distance between each data point vs the mean. So, as we can see here, the standard deviation is not a large value and quite similar on those months, that means that the temperatures on both months are clustered near the mean mentioned on point a). 

c) The percentiles also can tell us more information about the weather conditions on those months. Let’s analyze June: the 25% of the temperatures in this month are under 73 degrees and 75% of the temperatures are higher.  73 degrees is a very descent temperature to enjoy an ice cream.


# Summary

The weather analysis shows a favorable result for the business. Based on the statistics, looks like the temperature will not have an effect in success of this entrepreneurship. But let’s perform an additional analysis to confirm the previous statement. Remember that the early investment of W. Avy was ruined by rain, then I have complemented the study with additional queries. Below is the statistics of the precipitation for the months of June and December:

With these statistics, we confirm that the weather will not be a big deal nevertheless, we cannot ignore that December has the lower temperature and major average rainfall, these two factors allow us to identify a potential contraction of the activity in Oahu that could led to a decrease of effective demand but know that we know this information, we can include the necessary countermeasures to compensate this situation in our business plan.
